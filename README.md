# Gigr

A simple, privacy first app built for gig workers to track their daily earnings, shifts, and workload without connecting to any third-party gig platforms

> 🚧 *Currently in early development — completed authentication UI (Login & Signup) and now focusing on Add Record functionality using Jetpack Compose.
> Architecting the app from the ground up, with MVVM layers, state-driven UI, and composables written from scratch.
Any AI-generated code (e.g., Gemini-assisted snippets) is **fully reviewed, rewritten where necessary,
and committed in micro iterations** to maintain clean, human readable code quality and version control

## 🧭 Why Gigr?

Unlike most gig apps that request sensitive permissions or connect directly to your Uber, DoorDash, or Instacart accounts, Gigr takes a different path.  
We believe gig workers deserve safety, control, and transparency over their own data.

Gigr doesn’t read your messages, track your activity, or link to external apps.  
Instead, it lets you log your daily stats manually safely, privately, and on your terms.

> 💡 Your data stays with you ,no integrations, no hidden analytics, no risk.
